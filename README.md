# 4-DecisionTree_RandomForest

This repository is meant to provide examples of implementing a decision tree and a random forest in R.

**Decision Tree**: A series of "if this, then that" statements which leads to a final prediction. 

**Random Forest**: An ensemble of decision trees that use a random subset of features for each tree. The collection of decision trees vote on the final prediction.
